Thank you for chatting with us! How may I help you today?

Visitor
Do you offer mysql databases like amazon AWS RDS?

Samantha K.
We have hosting that has MySQL databases within, but not MySQL databases on their own

Visitor
How does one set it up and all that

Samantha K.
What will you be using the database for?

Visitor
various mysql needs for clients. PHP perhaps. Direct connect is most desirable though without that restriction. Like RDS
So a server instance with mysql that allows for connections on port 3306 or whatnot

Samantha K.
We could probably set you up on Ultimate Cpanel and you would be fine with that

Visitor
direct connect from the outside on that port or does it require IP whitelisting? How much does that cost? Is it limited compared to VPS?

Samantha K.
It requires IP whitelisting, its about $287 for three years, locking in a 50% discount. It is shared hosting so yes it will be limited compared to a Virtual Private Server

Visitor
what is the price for VPS? Or is that the page that shows $20 a month for 40GB that might also have mysql on it? Basically the cloud servers web page of yours that is a bit confusing to me at least

Samantha K.
I'm not sure where you're getting that pricing, our 1gb RAM with 40GB storage is 29.99/month if you don't have our team manage it for you

Samantha K.
I don't recommend cloud servers unless A.) you're developing constantly, or B.) you know how to command line in because there is no control panel or anything to help o nthat
on that *

Visitor
ok we certainly dont need a team to manage it for us. We just want a server like VPS that is powerful. At least 1GB RAM without feeling like we will get an email saying our users are using it too much and Go Away !

Samantha K.
Our 1gb RAM with 40GB storage is 29.99/month would probably be best then

Visitor
And that includes mysql? And that can be accessed remotely with IP whitelist only?

Samantha K.
You can do with or without IP whitelisting on a Virtual Private Server. And yes MySQL comes with it
Visitor
ok thanks.

Do you want me to get you set up on this? As we do have better discounts for annual terms

Visitor
Are we talking VPS and not Cloud Servers? What is your webpage link on it so I can see the price retail?

Samantha K.
Correct, https://www.godaddy.com/pro/managed-vps

Visitor
so if I went with your 3GB 90GB VPS and committed to a longer term you have a discount if I pay up front or commit?
And as it is a VPS if I so desired I could have apache or java/tomcat servers on it if I install it?

Samantha K.
Yes we have bigger discounts the longer you do
And yes you can install those options as well

Visitor

Alright, no rush, I am sure you have a lot of people in chat now. Just let me know the price for longer term, and whether or not "options" means same price, and if I have full control over the server to put new versions of java or whatever on at my discretion

Samantha K.

You can install any program that works with an apache system, so tomcat/java are ones you can install and its like your own playground to do what you want :) And 1 year would be $453.26, saving you $249.99. Or did you want me to go longer than that?

Visitor
ok

Samantha K.
Did you want to go with the one year, or do more?

Visitor
so it is a linux server I can install different versions of java on and ssh into it and do whatever I want? Mess it up completely and save off images or how does backup work and restore

Samantha K.
You would have to do your own back ups, if you wanted us to manage your back ups that is additional, but essentially yes

Visitor
ok. I will copy and paste all this into a document and talk to my clients. Thanks.

Samantha K.
Well when you're ready if you'd like to set it up with me you can email me at sknight@GoDaddy.com

Visitor
ok thx Samantha. Over and out
